### Design of a Private School Structure

- Assume that there are four (4) courses in programming languages: C#, Java, JavaScript and 
Python
- Every course has a title, a description and the type of it, Full Time for a 12 weeks morning classes 
scheme or a Part Time, a 24 weeks afternoon classes scheme.
- For example, the following courses might exist:

|Course title|Course Language|Course Description|Course Type|
|------------|---------------|------------------|-----------|
|CB13FTPY|Python|Python 12 weeks|Full Time|
|CB13PTPY|Python|Python 24 weeks|Part Time|
***
+ Also the are **Trainers** under each course with the following details,
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Subject
    
+ Also the are **Students** under each course with the following details,
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - Date of Birth
    - Tuition Fees

+ Also the are **Assignments** under each course with the following details,
    - Title
    - Description
    - Date of Submission
    - Mark for the Submitted Code
    - Mark for the Oral Mark

- This private school supports multiple courses.
- Each course can have multiple trainers, students and assignments.

- On this PART A, you are required to build a command prompt (shell) application.<br>
- The application must ask from the command prompt to input data to all the data <br>
structures and it should give the option to add more than one entry at a time .<br>
- If the user decides not to type any data, the program should use dummy data .<br><br>

Also, your program must be able to output the following:

1. A collection of all the students 
2. A collection of all the trainers 
3. A collection of all the assignments 
4. A collection of all the courses
5. All the students per course 
6. All the trainers per course 
7. All the assignments per course
8. All the assignments per student per course
9. A list of students that belong to more than one courses
